# Rust Exercism Course Solutions

These are programming exercises I completed on Exercism. I had a lot of fun with these since the problems are short and snappy and there are tests for immediate feedback.

In retrospect I should have just branched off the main rust exercism repo and worked on my branch, but I was a lot less comfortable with Git back when I started these.
